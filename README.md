# Islandora MRC Import [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ulsdevteam/islandora_ead_utility.png?branch=7.x)](https://travis-ci.org/ulsdevteam/islandora_ead_utility)

## Introduction

This module provides a method to import EAD Finding Aid files.

Upload either a EAD Finding Aid file and be able to:
1. Download a ZIP file containing the derived MODS XML files.
2. Apply the derived MODS to existing objects.
3. Access these functions from other modules.

## Requirements

This module requires PHP version 5.5 at least.  This module also requires the following modules/libraries:

* [Islandora](https://github.com/islandora/islandora)
* [Islandora Solr Search](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_solr_search) - Searches an Islandora Solr index.  This is required in order to find matching objects that have a specific MODS value.

**Required software**
